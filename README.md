# WalkWithMe

## _Be Open to the Unexpected_

WalkWithMe is a route planner based on [POSTGIS](https://postgis.net/) and [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) that is tailored to neighborhood walking paths. Coverage is currently limited to New York City, but can be expanded to additional locations with the use of OpenStreetMap feature extracts and/or locally maintained street grid geodata.

### To-Dos:

- Adapt frontend to TypeScript
- Create initialization / layer-loading routine to enable removal of hard-coded table IDs in server-side layer paths
-
