# WalkWithMe

## _Be Open to the Unexpected_

WalkWithMe is a route planner based on [POSTGIS](https://postgis.net/) and [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) that is tailored to neighborhood walking paths. Coverage is currently limited to New York City, but can be expanded to additional locations with the use of OpenStreetMap feature extracts and/or locally maintained street grid geodata.

## Status

WalkWithMe is **under active development**, meaning that implementation details may change at any time, and that new features are undergoing testing and refinement. Please feel free to identify and open issues as you encounter them.

### Current Functionality

Currently, users may plot intended walking routes using their preferred source of street grid data, then save and load the resulting feature groups with basic identifying information.

Automated routing is under development, and is on track for completion in the coming weeks.
